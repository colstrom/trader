The object of Trader is to make as much money as possible. All players start 
with $1000, and no materials. Buy and sell minerals to make money. Each time 
a turn ends, prices adjust on all minerals. The price variation can be up to 
a maximum of the value of the mineral, and is completely random. The more 
valuable a mineral is, the more subject it is to extreme fluctuations.

                                                                      Commands
